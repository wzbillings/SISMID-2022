# Exercise 1

Assume that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are *a priori* independent such that $\alpha \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\lambda_\alpha, \nu_\alpha)$ and $\beta \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\lambda_\beta, \nu_\beta)$. The data are independent draws from a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, i.e.
$$y_i \stackrel{\text{i.i.d}}{\sim} \mathrm{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta), \quad i = 1, \ldots, n.$$
Then, the posterior density of interest is
$$\pi(\alpha, \beta \mid y) \propto \pi(y\mid \alpha,\beta)\pi(\alpha)\pi(\beta)$$
and thus
$$\pi(\alpha, \beta \mid y) \propto \left( y^{\alpha - 1}e^{-\beta y} \right) \left( \beta^{\lambda_\beta - 1}e^{-\nu_\beta \beta} \right) \left(  \alpha^{\lambda_\alpha - 1}e^{-\nu_\alpha\alpha} \right).$$

# Exercise 2

Now we see that the full conditional densities of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
