# Day 1

* $p(y)$, the marginal distribution of $y$, is quite difficult to evaluate (even numerically) in high-dimensional cases. The focus of MCMC is then to compute Bayesian models without evaluating this integral.
* Conjugate prior: the prior has the same parametric form as the posterior distribution. Beta is conjugate for a binomial likelihood, and gamma is conjugate for a Poisson likelihood.
* Nonconjugate and weakly informative or flat priors can also be used but can be more computationally demanding.
* Posterior mean always lies between the prior mean and the sample mean for the chain binomial model (is this always true?).
